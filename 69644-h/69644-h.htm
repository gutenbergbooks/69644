<p class="hanging-indent1"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>:—<i>The Carpenter’s shop
is a low, broad
chamber built of wood. At the back to the
left-center a wide open doorway reveals a level
stretch of landscape. It is late afternoon, but
the air is still pale with the heat of day.
To the right of the door is a small square
window with wooden shutters thrown wide; before
it stands a carpenter’s bench upon which
lies a wooden door frame nearly finished. The
carpenter and his assistant are quietly at work
planing, and boring holes for the fitting in of the
rivets; beneath them the floor is strewn with
shavings, saw-dust, and odds and ends of wood.
Away to the left, near a spinning wheel, sits an
aged woman combing flax. Against the wall
to the same side of the doorway sits</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, <i>the
carpenter’s wife, with a book upon her knees;
on the other side her son stands against the
door-post, with his back to the interior, looking
out into the sunshine.</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>After the scene has opened the carpenter raises
himself from a stooping position, and hands
over to</i> <span class="smcap">Reuben</span>, <i>his assistant, a beam of wood,
which the latter lays aside.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Carpenter.</span> ’Twill soon be done. Nay, we’ll not
need that now. Yes, speak on. If you read slowly
enough, I can give heed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Reading</i>). “Because his visage was so
marred, many did marvel at him then, for more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
than most his form was scarred, yea, more than all
the sons of men. Yet him shall all the nations hear,
and kings shall shut their mouths for fear.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carpenter.</span> (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Reuben</span>) Be careful, now the
cross-beam’s laid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Anna.</span> What cause have kings to be afraid?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<i>Reading</i>) “Who hath believed our report?
To whom is the Lord’s arm revealed? He
shall grow up in tender sort, and as a root from a
dry field, having no form nor comeliness, that men
who see should scorn him less.”</p>

With the immensely increased demand for new
plays for purposes of production by amateurs
comes a correspondingly great demand for a careful
selection of those plays which can be easily
and well presented by clubs and colleges. The
plays in the present series have been chosen with
regard to their intrinsic value as drama and literature,
and at the same time to their adaptability to the needs and
limitations of such organizations.</p>

<p>The Series, under the personal supervision of Mr. Barrett H.
Clark, instructor in the department of Dramatic Literature at
Chautauqua, New York, assistant stage manager and actor with
Mrs. Fiske (season 1912-1913), now comprises 44 titles, more will make
their appearance during the year. Eventually there will be plays from
ancient Greece and Rome, Italy, Spain, France, Russia, Germany, and
the Scandinavian countries, representative of some of the best drama
of all ages and lands.</p>

<p>Each Play is prefaced by a concise historical note by Mr. Clark and
with a few suggestions for staging.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
